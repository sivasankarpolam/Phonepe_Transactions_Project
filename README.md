# PhonePe Transaction Data Analysis (2018-2024)
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of PhonePe transaction data from the years 2018 to 2024. The data was originally in JSON format and was converted into CSV using Python libraries. The primary objective of this analysis is to derive key insights from the transaction data using exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries, and dashboard visualizations in Power BI. These insights can help understand user behavior and transaction patterns across different states, districts, and pin codes.

## Tools Used
* Python (os, numpy, pandas): For converting the JSON data to CSV and performing EDA.
* MySQL: For importing the data and running SQL queries to gather deeper insights.
* Power BI: For creating dashboards to visually represent the data and insights for better understanding.
## Insights Generated
* Top State by Transaction Count: Maharashtra has the highest transaction count.
* Top State by Transaction Amount: Telangana leads in total transaction amount.
* Year with Most Transactions: The year 2023 saw the highest number of transactions.
* Transaction Count by Category: Merchant payments account for the highest number of transactions.
* Transaction Amount by Category: Peer-to-peer payments account for the largest transaction amounts.
* Top District by Transactions: Bengaluru Urban district leads in both transaction count and amount.
* Top Pincode by Transactions: Pincode 500001 has the highest transaction count and amount.
* Top Pincode by Registered Users: Pincode 201301 has the most registered users.
## Folder Structure
* data/: Contains the original JSON data and the converted CSV files.
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with Python code for data conversion and EDA.
* sql_queries/: SQL scripts used to extract insights from the MySQL database.
* dashboards/: Power BI dashboard files visualizing the key insights.
